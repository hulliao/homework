# The power of regexes is that you can make a pattern fuzzy
# Here are some simple rules
#    a     matches the letter a
#    B     matches the letter B
#    \w    matches any word symbol (letters, numbers, underscore)
#    \W    matches any non-word symbol
#    \d    matches any number
#    .     matches any character
#    \.    matches an actual dot
#    \s+   matches any number of whitespace/blank/space characters
#    \w+   matches any number of word symbols
#    \d+   matches any number of numbers
#    [ab]  matches the letter a or b
#    [a-d] matches the letters a, b, c, d
#    ()    used for capturing groups
#    \(    matches a left parenthese
#    \any character     matches any character
# The rules for regex are quite long, so it's best to have a cheat sheat handy
# You should make your own, and write it in Markdown (that's homework)
